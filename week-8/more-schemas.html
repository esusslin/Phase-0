<p>What is a one-to-one database?
* a database that features the id's of 2 items which have a one-to-one relationship?  because a one-to-one relationship occurs when 2 things have a single relationship to one another.
</p>

<p> When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
* to connect 2 things that have a single relationship to each other - in between these items in their respective databases perhaps?</p>

<p>What is a many-to-many database?
* a database a database that features many different entities that have multiple relationships between them all</p>


<p> When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

* you would use a many to many database to reflect many things and multiple internal relationships.

*data schemas rule - they make sense and their awesome visually</p>
