Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

* Github holds a set of files remotely (on a hard drive somewhere).  You can work on these files, but not on Github - you are going to have to create a duplicate copy on a local machine (you know what a computer is?).  To do this you have to basically load a copy of the repository that is stored on the hard drive into your local machine.  Once you work on and change the files you must hit save your work before uploading it back onto Github.

Describe what open source means.

* open source means that a given project is open to public sources of development - "free to the public to join in and work" if you will.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

* it feels overwhelming.  I haven't dabbled much in the open source world and the idea of unlimited access for all seems overwhelming and makes me nervous.  I need to learn more and familiarize myself more with open source projects to 

Assess the importance of using licenses.

* I would imagine licensing is incredibly important for patentable web products (are web products even patentable?)  

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

* had my first meltdown/crisis head-banging into the wall moment of Phase0 with this challenge.  I spent 3 hours beating myself up over what ended up being a folder structure error before finally (why 3 hours?!) reaching out to SLACK where @aaron1515, @tim.beck and @shaui6 were all very helpful.  It took us a bit but we identified my folder issues and things were quickly resolved.  MAJOR "aha" moment and of course the answer was simple and made sense.


SUGGESTION: make it clear that cloning a repository in a local directory CREATES the folder - this tripped me up; i was creating my own esusslin.github.io folder and that delayed the launching of my first website by 4 greuling hours of hell (I should've reached out to SLACK much sooner)
but alas it didn't stop me!
