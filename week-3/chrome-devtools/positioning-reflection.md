How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

* it provides a live display of the CSS / HTML relationship - adjustments can be made with the CSS and the positioning is immediately evident.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

* you can resize using height and width commands

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static is the default position for a single element on a page - every element begins as static.  Relative is the position of an element relative to itself. Absolute provides the ability to position an element relative to the page itself. Fixed provides the ability to position an element relative to the browser interface.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

* a margin is the demanded distance of one element to any other elements - a 'personal space' if you will.  A border is the actual 'fence' that contains an element and padding is the distance between the element itself and its border.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

* I thought this challenge was fairly simple overall compared to 3.3 HOWEVER I still feel like I have, at best, an elementary grip on positioning.  I still feel 'lost at sea' with regard to positioning and feel like I have a 15% grip on it.  By the end of next week I want at least an 80% grip on positioning and this challenge has cut my work out for me.
