## Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: hash of items and quantities
# steps: update quantity (value)
# output: revised shopping list

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
