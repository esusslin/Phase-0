What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1) Information gathering - this is basically the initial brainstorming about period where the purpose and goals of the website are established.  What are the goals of this website? Who is the target user population?  What does this website intend to provide and to whom?

2) Planning - the information from step 1 is essentially organized into a site map built with the user in mind.  

3) Design - The graphic design is brainstormed based on the information collected thus far.  Based on who the target audience is, a graphic designer begins to sketch out the visual elements of the site - what colors will be used?  In terms of visualization, what sort of atmosphere will the site provide?

4) Development - work begins on the the website's construction.  Working off the site map as a blueprint the actual website is built to include the design themes introduced in Step 3.

5)  Testing and delivery - the web designer will test the website for functionality and browser-compatability before the website files are uploaded to the server via FTP.  Plugin installation is implemented so the website achieves higher rankings in search engines and then the website is alive!

6) Maintenance - the last, vital and endless/ongoing step is the process of maintaining the website's functionality to commit the website to continue to meet its goals.  Ineviteably the site will need to grow and develop to remain relevant and successful at accomplishing its goals in an ongoing manner.
